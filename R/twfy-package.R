#' twfy: A package for accessing TheyWorkForYou
#'
#' twfy is an R wrapper around the API of TheyWorkForYou, a parliamentary
#' monitoring site that scrapes and repackages Hansard (the UK's parliamentary
#' record) and augments it with information from the Register of Members'
#' Interests, election results, and voting records to provide a unified
#' source of information about UK legislators and their activities.                                                    <http://www.theyworkforyou.com> for details.
#'
#' twfy functions currently mirror the structure and naming scheme of the API
#' as documented at \url{http://theyworkforyou.com/api/}. While the package
#' attempts where possible to provide more detail on structure of the API's
#' return values, this is not guaranteed to be correct and the link above
#' should be your primary source of documentation.
